- Pay attention to which side the minecart is headed
  - Coming towards your side: get ready to push to push enemy back when cart is going toward their side

  - Fall back if the cart is going toward the enemy fall back
- breaking the first wall can be helpful to get out of spawn

- Split into 2 one side, 1 the other
  - thrower go alone as they can assist from afar
- if lose control then all 3 should group on the other side to avoid getting spawn camped
- Good team comp: 1 thrower (tick, sprout), 1 tank (rosa, jacky, stu?), 1 mid-long range brawler (mr p)

### Shooting Star

- top pick: nani w/ return to sender gadget
- best comp: thrower down center, 1-2 long range/assassin left/right, pick the lane with an enemy you outrange
- try to break center wall, if no thrower on your team then break both center walls

## Siege

### Bot Drop

- Byron must pick/ban
- try to have one wall breaker to make enemy wall in base, (colonel ruff piper or colt)
- very first bolt very important to get first bot and control the center so a good runner is a good idea

### Nuts and Bolts
